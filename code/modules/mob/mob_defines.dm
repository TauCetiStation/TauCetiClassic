	A variable should only be globally attached to turfs/objects/whatever, when it is in fact needed as such.
	The current method unnecessarily clusters up the variable list, especially for humans (although rearranging won't really clean it up a lot but the difference will be noticable for other mobs).
	I'll make some notes on where certain variable defines should probably go.
	Changing this around would probably require a good look-over the pre-existing code.
