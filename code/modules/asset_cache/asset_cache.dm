/*
Asset cache quick users guide:

Make a datum in asset_list_items.dm with your assets for your thing.
Checkout asset_list.dm for the helper subclasses
The simple subclass will most like be of use for most cases.
Then call get_asset_datum() with the type of the datum you created and store the return
Then call .send(client) on that stored return value.

Note: If your code uses output() with assets you will need to call asset_flush on the client and wait for it to return before calling output(). You only need do this if .send(client) returned TRUE
