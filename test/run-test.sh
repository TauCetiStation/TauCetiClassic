# This is the entrypoint to the testing system, written for Baystation12 and
# inspired by Rust's configure system
#
# Warn: this is modified version of run-test.sh that Baystation12 uses, so keep that in mind.
#
# The general structure of the test execution is as follows:
# - find_code:              Look for the project root directory and fail fast if
#                           it can't be found. Assumes that it is in . or ..;
#                           custom locations can be specified in CODEPATH
#                           environment variable.
# - run_all_tests:          Run every test group in sequence.
# - run_xxx_tests:          Run the tests for $xxx, doing any necessary setup
#                           first, including calling find_xxx_deps.
# - find_xxx_deps:          Using need_cmd, ensure that programs needed to run
#                           tests that are part of $xxx are available.
# - need_cmd:               Checks availability of command passed as the single
#                           argument. Fails fast if it's not available.
# - err:                    Prints arguments as text, exits indicating failure.
# - warn:                   Prints arguments as text, indicating a warning
#                           condition.
# - msg:                    Used by all printing, formats text nicely.
# - run_test:               Runs a test. The first argument is the friendly name
#                           of the test. The remaining arguments are the shell
#                           command(s) to run. If a test fails, a global counter
#                           is incremented and a warning is emitted.
# - run_test_fail:          Exactly as run_test, but considers failure of the
#                           command to be a successful test.
# - exec_test:              Called by run_test{,fail}, actually executes the
#                           test and returns its resulti.
# - check_fail:             Called at the end of the run, prints final report
# and sets exit status appropriately.
# !!!!!!!! Instructions for adding tests:
# In general, if you want to add a test, it will probably belong to one of the
# groups that already exists. Add it to the relevant run_xxx_tests function, and
# if it introduces any new dependencies, add them to the check_xxx_deps
# function. Some dependencies are guaranteed to be on CI platforms by outside
# means (like .travis.yml), others will need to be installed by this script.
# You'll see plenty of examples of checking for CI and gating tests on that,
# installing instead of checking when running on CI.
#
# If you are *SURE* you need to add a new test group, you'll want to add it
# first to the case at the end of the file, and then add the run_xxx_tests and
# find_xxx_deps for it, adding things to them as appropriate. Importantly, make
# sure to also call run_xxx_tests from run_all_tests. Make sure also to call
# your find_xxx_deps from run_xxx_tests.
#
# Good luck!
